NOTES:

1.- When dividing the environment into two (for variables in t & u, in a derivation rule with more than one hypothesis), we should be checking that the intersection of FV(t) and FV(u) is formed only by duplicable variables (i.e. those of type B^n), because otherwise we would be risking duplicating non-duplicable variables (and thus, cloning non-clonable qbits). We're not going to check this, since checking would have a cost of O(n^2) (gotta check the existence on the second set, for every variable from the first set). Instead, we're going to let the type checker continue running, since a non empty intersection would mean that we would be eliminating the variables in that intersection (which are free variables on both hypothesis) from both "sub-environments", thus producing a failure to type the hypothesis later on. This would have a linear cost, since the maximum size of the environment is the height of our hypothesis tree, so going in depth to check the leaves is, at tops, the size of the env (therefore O(n)).

2.- We do not type probabilistic distribution since they're only top level terms, produced by reduction, and that we can represent as a list of pairs with a side condition (Sum of p_i = 1).
